            Thank you for completing your body scan with Phy Health.
            Your scan data is now being processed and then reviewed by your coach to achieve a full kinetic chain analysis and 3D body map.

        <div class="description">
            After processing is completed, youâ€™ll receive an email to schedule your initial 45-minute assessment.
            The assessment happens via video call with your Phy Coach and will allow the two of you to review your results and comprehensive care plan in detail.
